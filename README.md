# Feature-Enhancement-for-Object-Detectors

This is the official implementation of Paper Feature Enhancement for Object Detectors.



* The early stage of the backbone is trained to detect small features more effectively, similar to the characteristics of an edge detector.
* The later stage of the backbone is trained to blur small features, like a Gaussian filter, and focus more on detecting larger features.
* The new training method leads to an increase in AP (Average Precision) for both large and small objects.
